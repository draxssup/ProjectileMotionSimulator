# Projectile Motion Simulation

This project simulates the motion of a projectile (like a ball or a bullet) under the influence of gravity. It uses basic physics equations to calculate the trajectory of the projectile and then plots the path using matplotlib.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. Enter the initial velocity and launch angle when prompted.
2. The script will display a plot showing the trajectory of the projectile.
